            In the next pages, you will be asked 3 times to create a playlist of 5 songs. <br>
            You will need to do this in 3 different versions of the systems. <br>
            In each system, you will first have as much
            time as you want to explore the system and you can ask questions if you want.<br>
            Second, you will have as much time as you want to create the playlist.<br>
            Once you finished the playlist, you will be asked to fill in some questions to evaluate the system in
            which you created the playlist.
