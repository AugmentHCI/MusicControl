        p(style='white-space:pre;').
            For the first task, we ask you to look for songs you want to listen while travelling.
            The system will provide you a list of your favorite artist. From this list, you need to select one or
            more artists, but with a maximum of five artist.
        h2 Parameters
        p The system also let you interact with five different parameters:
        ul
            li Energy
                p(class="parLegend" style='white-space:pre;').
                    Energy represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
                    Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
            li Valence
                p(class="parLegend"  style='white-space:pre;').
                    A measure describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
                    Tracks with high valence sound more positive,
                    while tracks with low valence sound more negative.
            li Acousticness
                p(class="parLegend" style='white-space:pre;').
                    A confidence measure whether the track is acoustic.
                    100 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
            li Instrumentalness
                p(class="parLegend"  style='white-space:pre;').
                    Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.
                    Values above 50 are intended to represent instrumental tracks,
                    but confidence is higher as the value approaches 100.
            li Danceability
                p(class="parLegend" style='white-space:pre;').
                    Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing.
                    100 represents high confidence the track is danceable.
