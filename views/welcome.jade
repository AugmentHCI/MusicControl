            | You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide
            | whether to participate, it is important for you to understand why the
            | research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read
            | the following information carefully. Ask questions if anything is not
            | clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether
            | or not you wish to take part. Thank you for your time.
        h2 About the study:
        p
            em
            | In this study, you will evaluate two visual techniques designed
            |       to control music recommendation in Spotify. In the next step, you will
            |       be asked to login to the experiment with your Spotify account. After you have logged in,
            |       you will be asked to complete a demographic questionnaire. You will then be presented with a
            |       recommender interface where you will select up to 5 of your favourite artists and
            |       modify 5 music attributes (energy, valence, acousticness, instrumentalness
            |       and danceability) according to a task that will be presented to you. Once
            |       you have completed the task, you will be presented with a questionnaire to
            |       evaluate the interface. Next, you will evaluate a second recommender
            |       interface with a different task, the steps of which are the same as the
            |       first evaluation. After you have completed the second evaluation
            |       questionnaire, you will finally be asked to provide suggestions
            |       about your ideal visual techniques for controlling music recommendation.
        h2 Procedure:
        p This experiment includes the following 6 procedures:

                li Post-task questionnaire
                li Post-evaluation questions
        p.caution
